<h1>About Me</h1>

<P>I work in the IT support department of a hospital, where every day brings challenges that demand fast, practical, and human-centered solutions. Behind every printer that works again or every system that gets restored, there's a doctor providing better care, a nurse accessing critical information, or a patient receiving timely attention. This experience has taught me that technology isn't just about code and screens — it's a real-world tool to improve lives.</P>
<P>With that conviction, I began training as a web developer through Angela Yu’s bootcamp. I'm learning the fundamentals of web development, from structure and logic to design and functionality. Every project I build is not only a technical step forward but also an opportunity to explore how to create intuitive, useful, and meaningful solutions for real users.</P>
<P>This portfolio is a reflection of my journey. Here you'll find projects I've built from scratch, applying what I learn with dedication and curiosity. I truly believe in the power of combining hands-on experience in real-life environments with solid programming knowledge. I'm building this path with the certainty that, even in the digital world, every line of code can have a real-world impact.</P>
