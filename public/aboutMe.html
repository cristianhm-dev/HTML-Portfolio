<h1>About Me.</h1>

<P>I am an IT technician with hands-on experience in environments where mistakes aren’t just technical—they're human. Since 2022, I’ve been providing remote support for the British Hospital of Uruguay, the country’s most prestigious healthcare institution. In that high-stakes environment, I’ve learned to respond with speed, clarity, and empathy—solving system failures, managing access issues, and guiding medical staff through essential digital tools that directly impact patient care.</P>
<P>Before that, I managed my own food service ventures within prominent educational institutions such as IAVA High School and CETP’s Central Building. That entrepreneurial experience gave me sharp problem-solving skills, adaptability, and the ability to lead under pressure. I also completed a food safety certification with the Municipality of Montevideo and received specialized training from the Ministry of Public Health in 2023 and 2024, focusing on standards and practices for health-sector personnel.</P>
<P>Currently, I’m expanding my professional path. I’m studying to become a computer science teacher at INET – IPA and learning web development through Angela Yu’s internationally renowned bootcamp. My goal is to combine real-world technical experience, an educational mindset, and a passion for web technologies to create digital solutions that work, serve, and matter. I believe the most valuable tech isn’t what dazzles—it’s what solves, supports, and truly improves people’s lives.</P>
